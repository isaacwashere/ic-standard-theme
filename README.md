## IC Standard VSCode Theme

This is a theme, based off of Atom One Dark(AOD)

### Why I Did It

I'd like to have my own version of AOD that I can edit, and tinker with


### How to Use

> Go to your `.vscode` or `.vscode-insiders` folder 

> Navigate to the `extensions` folder

> Inside the `extensions` folder clone this repo

> Open VS Code, go to Settings >> Color Theme and select the theme

### Disclaimer

This is taken from AOD and mildly edited (very, very mildly).

Feel free to take and use as a template/starting point for your own theme.
